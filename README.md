# My Tasks ðŸ“‹

A simple task manager built with **React Native**  **Expo**. Add tasks, get reminded via local notifications & manage them with basic animations and async storage.

## Demo

  Unsupported browser 
</video>

## ðŸš€ Features

-  Add new tasks with one tap
-  Get notified 10 seconds after adding a task via local notifications 
-  Tasks are saved using AsyncStorage 
-  Toggle task completion with strike line 
-  Delete tasks
-  Basic fade in and out animations using Reanimated 3

---

## Problems Faced and Solutions
- Had to find a workaround for local notifications as SDK 53+ had removed support for local notifications via expo go, so I had to switch to dev build in expo to make it work
- For animations, I had used LayoutAnimations but in the new arch it does not work properly so had to switch to Reanimated 3
